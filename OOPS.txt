class is logical construct.
objects are physical.
static variables are property of class rather than individual object.
final methods cannot be overridden | final classes cannot  be inherited;
pillars of OOPS :
I) Inheritance :
    hierarchical
    multiple
    single
    hybrid
II) polymorphism :
    compile time : same name of methods but different return type, arguments, number of arguments
    runtime : overriding methods

    static methods do not depend on objects, and overriding methods is based on objects. so static methods cannot
    be overridden.
III) && IV) encapsulation and abstraction : just show the VERY necessary part only
            abstraction is thinking about design (what is needed)
            encapsulation is implementing the abstraction (doing the actual code)

access modifiers : public : access from anywhere
                   private : only access in same class file
                   protected : only cannot access from different package and not subclass
                   default : access from same class, package and same package subclass
